My name is Vijay Nair. My full name is Vijayakrishnan Ramesan Nair. I am software architect and a java developer 
who is currently trying to get hands on artificial intelligence.
I am originally from Trivandrum, Kerala, India but currently settled in Melbourne, Florida, US. I moved to US 
in 2010 but then moved back to India on 2017 when the Visa expired. 
However, I moved back to US in 2023 on my green card. I love all kinds of food specially the spicy ones. 
I am not a sporty person, so I do not watch sports a lot but only to make some coversations specially around 
cricket and soccer.
